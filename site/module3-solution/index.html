            <h2 class=" text-center ">Chicken</h2>
            <p id="chicken">The chickens that saved Western civilization were discovered, according to legend, by the side of a road in Greece in the first decade of the fifth century B.C. The Athenian general Themistocles, on his way to confront the invading Persian
                forces, stopped to watch two cocks fighting and summoned his troops, saying: “Behold, these do not fight for their household gods, for the monuments of their ancestors, for glory, for liberty or the safety of their children, but only because
                one will not give way to the other.” The tale does not describe what happened to the loser, nor explain why the soldiers found this display of instinctive aggression inspirational rather than pointless and depressing. But history records
                that the Greeks, thus heartened, went on to repel the invaders, preserving the civilization that today honors those same creatures by breading, frying and dipping them into one’s choice of sauce. The descendants of those roosters might
                well think—if they were capable of such profound thought—that their ancient forebears have a lot to answer for. Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple cultural boundaries with ease. With its mild taste and uniform
                texture, chicken presents an intriguingly blank canvas for the flavor palette of almost any cuisine. A generation of Britons is coming of age in the belief that chicken tikka masala is the national dish, and the same thing is happening
                in China with Kentucky Fried Chicken. Long after the time when most families had a few hens running around the yard that could be grabbed and turned into dinner, chicken remains a nostalgic, evocative dish for most Americans. When author
                Jack Canfield was looking for a metaphor for psychological comfort, he didn’t call it “Clam Chowder for the Soul.” How did the chicken achieve such cultural and culinary dominance? It is all the more surprising in light of the belief by
                many archaeologists that chickens were first domesticated not for eating but for cockfighting. Until the advent of large-scale industrial production in the 20th century, the economic and nutritional contribution of chickens was modest.
                In Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond listed chickens among the “small domestic mammals and domestic birds and insects” that have been useful to humanity but unlike the horse or the ox did little—outside of legends—to change the course
                of history. Nonetheless, the chicken has inspired contributions to culture, art, cuisine, science and religion over the millennia. Chickens were, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures. The prodigious and ever-watchful hen was
                a worldwide symbol of nurturance and fertility. </p>

            <h2 class=" text-center ">Beef</h2>
            <p id="beef">Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled.
                The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method
                the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.Grading standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large
                international beef trade. In the United States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner. Commercial grades are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner
                grades are used in processed meat products. Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.The primary beef-consuming countries of the world (in per capita terms) are Uruguay, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia,
                and the United States. Beef is relatively scarce—and not particularly popular—in most of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent; the sanctity of the cow in the Hindu religion forbids the consumption of its meat by Hindu adherents.
                Beef is not unusual in the cuisines of Korea and Japan, however; in Kōbe, Japan, near Ōsaka, a highly prized beef is produced from cattle that are vigorously massaged and fed a liberal dietary supplement of beer.Butchering practices differ
                among countries, resulting in a variety of names for the different cuts. In the United States, where beef is the most popular meat, steaks—cross-sections from the fleshier parts of the carcass—are among the most desirable cuts. The standing
                rib roast, called in Britain the best rib, is also a valued cut. Less desirable cuts may be pot-roasted, used in stews, or ground (see hamburger). Boiled beef is popular in some cuisines, as in the French dish known as pot-au-feu. Corned
                beef (or salt beef in Britain) is a brisket or rump cut that has been pickled in brine.Butchering practices differ among countries, resulting in a variety of names for the different cuts. In the United States, where beef is the most popular

            <h2 class="text-center ">Sushi</h2>
            <p id="sushi">
                Sushi is popular around the world, but that doesn't mean everyone understands what this dish technically is. For starters, sushi does not not always mean raw fish. Rather, it's that raw fish - sashimi in Japanese - is the most popular ingredient in sushi.
                The term sushi actually refers to foods that use a type of rice seasoned with vinegar and are garnished with raw fish or vegetable. The sushi rolls (maki) that you may be imagining are just one of many types of sushi. It's important to
                know this before you visit Japan, or you're bound to be confused when visiting a sushi restaurant. If you're traveling to Japan or just want to learn more about the cuisine, the best thing to do is to read up on the different types of
                sushi and prepare your taste buds for some true Japanese delicacies. The Different Types of Sushi There are several types of sushi, making it an appealing food to people with a wide range of tastes. One form of sushi, nigiri-zushi, are
                hand-formed mounds of rice with a dab of wasabi topped with various ingredients. Popular nigiri-zushi include maguro (tuna), toro (belly of tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), and ebi (shrimp). Maki-zushi is the Japanese name for sushi rolls.
                A sheet of nori (dried seaweed) is layered with sushi rice, and a row of fish and vegetables. The sheet is then tightly rolled with a makisu. After that the roll is sliced into pieces, plated, and served. Rolls such as these are called
                norimaki. Tekkamaki (tuna rolls) and kappamaki (cucumber rolls) are two common versions.Additionally, inari-zushi are deep-fried tofu pouches stuffed with sushi rice which are brown and oval-shaped, and chirashi-zushi are sushi served
                on a plate or bowl with different ingredients on top of rice. While fish is very widely used in sushi, you'll also encounter likely uni (sea urchin) and ikura (salmon roe). Most of the fish used in sushi is served raw, but there are some
                exceptions. Sometimes you'll find seared fish on sashimi menus and unagi (eel) is always cooked before serving. The key seasonings used in sushi are soy sauce and wasabi (Japanese horseradish). Soy sauce is used as a dipping sauce, and
                wasabi is put in nigiri-zushi and may also be mixed with soy sauce for dipping (expect upset looks if you do this in a high-end sushi restaurant). Also, pickled ginger (called gari) is commonly served with sushi to serve as a palate cleanser.
                Green tea (agari) is the best drink to pair with sushi. How to Eat Sushi If you have the pleasure of eating sushi in Japan or at a high-end sushi restaurant elsewhere in the world, there is a certain etiquette that you should follow. Both
                to fully enjoy the flavors of the fish, and to not insult your chef who worked so hard to prepare your meal. Sashimi should be eaten with chopsticks, but other types of sushi can and should be eaten with your hands. When picking up a piece
                of nigiri, hold it with your hands and dip only the fish into your soy sauce. Try your best to eat the whole thing in one bite. For a more detailed information, read our guide to eating sushi like a pro. Where to Get Authentic Japanese
                Sushi Sushi is probably Japan's most famous dish - but it can be expensive. At traditional omakase-style places, you can usually order a set of sushi with a fixed price, which comes in handy for group outings, or you can order your favorite
                sushi pieces as you eat your meal. For reasonably priced sushi, there are places called kaiten-zushi, where the sushi plates circle around the eating area on a conveyor belt. These restaurants are to be found almost everywhere in Japan.
                When you go to such a restaurant, you wait until your desired sushi plate passes near you, and then pick up the plate from the moving belt. If your favorites aren't available, you can also order them from the kitchen. Prices for this inexpensive
                kind of sushi vary. There is no lack of incredible sushi restaurants in Japan. Perhaps the most famous is Sukiyabashi Jiro - a small eatery in the Ginza neighborhood of Tokyo. If you're lucky enough to eat here, you're in for the most
                authentic Japanese sushi in all of Japan.</p>
